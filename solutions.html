<h2>Solutions</h2>
<div class=plaintext>
    <h2>What we're doing</h2>
    <h3>Legislation</h3>
    The only thing more powerful than a group of christian mothers is a well-connected group of christian mothers. Many of us have husbands in Washington, and we will pressure them into enacting drastic legislation designed to fight "loli hentai".
    <h3>Praying</h3>
    In our fight against Satan, we take solice in knowing God is on our side. All we must do is ask him, and he will provide. 
    <h3>Military action</h3>
    We can't let God do all the work. Our aforementioned husbands in Washington have the power to declare war, and WILL be necessary. Did you think Hiroshima was bad? When we find out whatever satanic hellhole produces this "loli hentai", as God is our witness we will make Little Boy look like a fucking firecracker.
    <h3>Community outreach</h3>
    Our communities are full of good souls who would help, but aren't aware of the issue. To inform these good souls about the problem, and our fight against it, is as important as the fight itself.

    <h2>What you can do if your child watches loli hentai</h2>
    <h3>Pray</h3>
    In troubled times, we must turn to God. Ask him, and he will show the way. If he does not help, it is because your troubles are His test for you, and you must show that you are willing to do what he commands of you.
    <h3>Rehabilitation</h3>
    Loli hentai is like any other addiction, only worse. Rehabilitation is an option, but you must proceed with patience. If your child is addicted he won't return to God's path in a day. Start off by turning him onto regular hentai, with adults instead of children. Then show him pornography of actual people, instead of drawings. Then, show him movies of a gradually decreasing lewdness. One day he will simply be watching movies, as if nothing ever happened, and you can know your child is back in God's graces.
    <h3>Euthanasia</h3>
    Rehabilitation doesn't always work. Your child may resist any of the steps above. Perhaps they insist the character they are pleasuring themselves to is actually "thousands of years old". There is no known way to solve this, and your only option may be to end your child's life. A bullet to the head may be the quickest option, but blood and brains are difficult to get out of a carpet. Poison may seem tempting, but the insuing diarrhea and vomit will be no less of a challenge to clean up. We recommend strangling your child to death with some sort of wire.
