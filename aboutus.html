    <h2>About us</h2>
    <div class="plaintext">
        We are a coalition of christian mothers that are concerned, angered and shocked by a new craze among our children called "loli hentai". <br> We aim to end this scourge on our children's purity and innocence, and we want you to join our fight. <br> You may not realize how big of a problem loli hentai is. We don't blame you, because most people don't know how to recognize a loli hentai fan. If you'd like to learn, look below for an image of a typical loli hentai consumer. <br> <br>

        Notice in particular the withered, soulless eyes and the severe cranial damage.
