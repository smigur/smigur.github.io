    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <div class="plaintext">
        Our mission is to stop the distribution and consumption of "loli hentai", particularly among christian children. We hope to acomplish this goal through different means, all outlined in the <a href="solutions.html">solutions page.</a> By 2025 we hope to decrease consumption of "loli hentai" by 50%, and by 2030 we hope to eliminate it completely. The specific projections are outlined in the graph below.<br>

        <b>PS: Our projection predicts that consumption of loli hentai after year 2030 will be negative. We are unsure what this will entail, but we are looking forward to it.
